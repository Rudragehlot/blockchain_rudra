# Prediction Market Smart Contract

## Vision

The Prediction Market project aims to create a decentralized platform where users can make predictions on future events and earn rewards based on the accuracy of their predictions. By leveraging blockchain technology, this platform offers transparency and ensures fair management of the prediction process, making it an ideal solution for users who wish to engage in betting on outcomes of real-world events.

## Features

- **Create Prediction Event**: Users can create a prediction event, which allows others to place bets on a particular outcome.
- **Bet Placement**: Participants can place bets on a prediction event, selecting "Yes" or "No" based on their prediction of the event's outcome.
- **Pooled Betting**: The contract maintains separate pools for "Yes" and "No" bets, which accumulate based on the users' predictions.

## Contract Address

- **Network**: Aptos Mainnet/Testnet
- **Contract Address**: `0x4420a900882be89f9c8b53a583bffa017e6bedb4e57cf9b0fa7b52fd90a08aa6` (Replace with the actual contract address once deployed)

## How It Works

1. **Create Event**:

   - Users can call the `create_event` function to create a new prediction event.
   - The prediction event starts with zero tokens in both "Yes" and "No" pools, and the outcome is initially unresolved.

2. **Place Bet**:
   - Participants can call the `place_bet` function to place a bet on the outcome of the prediction event.
   - Users specify the creator's address, the amount of tokens they wish to bet, and their prediction ("Yes" or "No").
   - The function adds the bet amount to either the "Yes" or "No" pool based on the user's prediction.

## Future Scope

- **Event Resolution**: Add functionality to allow event creators or an oracle to resolve the event outcome, and distribute the pooled funds to winning bettors.
- **Payout Mechanism**: Implement a payout mechanism to distribute rewards to winning users based on their bet amount and the total pool size.
- **Oracle Integration**: Integrate a decentralized oracle service to provide reliable data for determining the outcomes of real-world events.
- **Betting Limits**: Introduce betting limits to prevent manipulation and ensure fair participation in each prediction event.
- **Event Metadata**: Add support for detailed event metadata (such as event description and timeline) for better user experience.
- **Governance Mechanism**: Create a community-driven governance mechanism to decide which events can be added to the platform.

## Getting Started

- Clone this repository and install the necessary dependencies for the Aptos blockchain.
- Deploy the contract using your preferred deployment tool.
- Once deployed, users can create prediction events and place bets through the smart contract functions.
